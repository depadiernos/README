A short manual for how depadiernos works.

## What do you want us to know about your communication style?

- I like to be honest but make sure my criticism is worded in a positive way.
- I tackle all things as they come at me and sometimes that means you won't have my whole attention. But don't worry, I'm not ignoring you. 
- I love to learn new things! I enjoy learning correct things about wrong things I thought were correct. :)
- I have a hard time asking for help in the past. I now ask questions... a lot of questions. And love to answer questions, too! Let's help each other grow.
- I prefer a less async way of communicating if possible, but I'm ok with an async/living doc or an email too.

## What are some useful things to know in advance about your style?

- My first thought is 'How can I help?'
- I am generally unconvinced of my correctness, and self-deprecating.
- I am a guesser as well (see https://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2010/05/askers-vs-guessers/340891/)
- I am a nice guy and like to compliment the good I see in people.  
- I am an introvert but not anti-social.
- I hardly get mad or upset and will always try to spin a negative into a positive.

## How can you best work with me?

- If you want me to do something, ping me and put it down on my calendar. If I don't get a ping, I blissfully unaware of calendar events until the set time.
- I like honest and thoughtful feedback. I'd rather hear that I sucked at something than not hear about it at all. I take criticism well. I also like a compliment every so often. :)
- Don't hesitate to correct me. I never take corrections or criticism negatively. Ever.

## What are your pet peeves?

- not telling me if I'm wrong or not doing the right thing.  I will do you the same courtesy.
- uncommunicated expectations. It totally throws me off if I'm working towards one set of expectations, while others are comparing me to a completely different set of expectations.
- unwillingness to question assumptions.  I don't believe the world matches our expectations and try not to act on mine.

## What are your self-perceived biggest shortcomings?

- I can get a bit of tunnel vision. I call it falling into a rabbithole. If you see me being too quiet, don't hesitate to interrupt. You might be saving me from falling into the rabbithole.
- I am very bad at reading negative situations. I can still think a person is a saint even as I'm getting punched by that person!
- I always feel like I don't know enough. I put a lot of pressure on myself to learn and know as much as I can. It helps to have good teammates that I can feel 'safe' not knowing something right off the bat.
